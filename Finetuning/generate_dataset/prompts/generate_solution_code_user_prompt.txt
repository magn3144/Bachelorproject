You are given a web page, the category of the page, the first part of the html body of the page, the local path to the HTML file that should be scraped and a web-scraping task that you should solve.

The page is from this website: {website}

The local path to the HTML file is {HTML_file}

The category is: {category}

Here is some code from the target HTML file:
{HTML_string}

The task is: {task}

Now generate a python script that solves this task by extracting the target data from the HTML file. Make sure the script works when I run it, without any modifications. The script you generate should always save the scraped data as a CSV file. You don't necessarily have much information of the structure of the website, so its a good idea to write generalised code that doesn't depend on the specific class names and such. Unless you can find the relevant information in the code of course.
