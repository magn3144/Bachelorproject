You are given a web page, the category of the page, randomly selected html elements on that page, the local path to the HTML file that should be scraped and a web-scraping task that you should solve.

The page is from this website: {website}

The local path to the HTML file is {HTML_file}

The category is: {category}

Here are some randomly selected HTML elements (containing text) from the target page:
{HTML_string}

The task is: {task}

Now generate a python script that solves this task by extracting the target data from the HTML file.
Make sure the script works when I run it, without any modifications.
The script you generate should always save the scraped data as a CSV file with the name 'scraped_data.csv'.
You can use the given HTML elements above to gain information about the page.
