You are given a link to a page, the category of that page, and some randomly selected HTML tags with text.

In this case the website is: {link}

The category is: {category}

Here are some randomly selected HTML elements (containing text), and their corresponding XPaths from the target page:
{HTML_string}

Now generate a list of web-scraping task(s).
Do NOT include specific details from the randomly selected HTML elements (like class or tag type).
For example if the website is https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaming+keyboard, then you could generate the task: “Get all product names and prices from this product page. Save them as a CSV file.”
The goal of the scraping task should always be to save information as a CSV file.
The amount of task(s) you should generate is: {num_tasks}
You can take inspiration from the randomly selected HTML elements above.
